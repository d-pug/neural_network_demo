# Neural Network Demo
This is a simple demo showcasing how a neural network fits a function. It uses numpy and keras, so make sure you have those packages installed before running this script.
## How it works
python neutral_network_tf.py 

You should see the training process and a plot showing the training loss and the predicted vs. the expected function.
